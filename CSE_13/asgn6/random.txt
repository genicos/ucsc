It was almost noon, and we still had more than a hundred miles to go. They would
be tough miles. Very soon, I knew, we would both be completely twisted. But
there was no going back, and no time to rest. We would have to ride it out.
Press registration for the fabulous Mint 400 was already underway, and we had to
get there by four to claim our sound-proof suite. A fashionable sporting
magazine in New York had taken care of the reservations, along with this huge
red Chevy convertible we'd just rented off a lot on the Sunset Strip ... and I
was, after all, a professional journalist; so I had an obligation to cover the
story, for good or ill.
